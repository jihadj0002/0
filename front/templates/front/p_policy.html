    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">1. Purpose and Commitment</h2>
    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">Matrix Ai, hereinafter referred to as MatrixAI,” “we,” “our,” or “us,” offers a global Software-as-a-Service platform dedicated to conversational commerce, chat automation, and associated analytics. Safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all Personal Data entrusted to us is intrinsic to our corporate mission. This Privacy and Data Protection Policy (“Policy”) therefore explains, in a transparent and exhaustive manner, the principles and procedures through which we collect, process, retain, disclose, and protect information. The Policy reflects the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the California Consumer Privacy Act as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, ISO/IEC 27001:2022, and all other relevant federal, state, and international privacy statutes and recognised industry standards. By accessing or utilising any component of the Matrix Ai platform, its websites, or its administrator portals (collectively, the “Services”), you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and accepted the practices articulated herein.</p>

  <section id="definitions" class="mb-8">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">2. Definitions</h2>
    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">For the purposes of this Policy, the expression “Personal Data” designates any information that directly or indirectly identifies a natural person, as set forth in Article 4(1) of the GDPR or in analogous legislation. The term “Processing” encompasses every conceivable operation performed upon Personal Data, including but not limited to collection, storage, transmission, or erasure. The “Controller” is the natural or legal person that determines the purposes and means of Processing; in our commercial context this role is ordinarily fulfilled by our business-to-business Clients. Matrix AI acts as “Processor” whenever we perform Processing on behalf of such a Controller. A “Sub-processor” is any third-party entity that Matrix AI authorises to process Personal Data under a written agreement. The term “Client” denotes a corporate subscriber to Matrix AI Services, whereas “End User” refers to any individual who interacts with a Client through channels powered by Matrix AI technology.</p>

  <section id="scope" class="mb-8">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">3. Scope</h2>
    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">This Policy governs three principal categories of Processing activity:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
      <li><strong>Client-Provided Data:</strong> Chat transcripts, customer identifiers, uploaded files, and related metadata transmitted through the Services, where Matrix AI functions as Processor.</li>
      <li><strong>Administrative or Account Data:</strong> Collected directly from Clients for billing, authentication, and platform administration, where Matrix AI acts as Controller.</li>
      <li><strong>Visitor Data:</strong> Gathered from users of our public web properties, processed in a Controller capacity.</li>
    </ul>

  <section id="lawful-bases" class="mb-8">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">4. Lawful Bases for Processing</h2>
    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">When Matrix AI operates as Controller of Administrative or Visitor Data, it relies on one or more lawful bases established by Article 6 of the GDPR:</p>

      <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> Processing necessary for secure and efficient Service operation, without overriding data subject rights.</li>
      <li><strong>Explicit consent:</strong> Obtained for optional activities (e.g., marketing communications, non-essential cookies), withdrawable at any time.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal obligations:</strong> Processing required to satisfy statutory or regulatory requirements.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">For Client-Provided Data, Clients must document the lawful basis in the Data Processing Agreement.</p>
