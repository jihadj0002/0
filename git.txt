git clone is for cloning a reposotory 

Try to use git add before commiting the file

>>> git status
for getting the data of which of the files are commited or not

>>> git add <file name>
For adding a Specific file for staging          File then staging then commit

>>> git commit -m "<Message>"
This is for commiting and -m is for Message or comment make sure it's descripted

>>> git log
For viewing commit history

>>> git log --oneline
For Showing Each commits on one line with shortcodes

Undoing commits:
Checkout commit         Revert commit           Reset commit


Checkout commit:
>>> git checkout <log adress>
This will take you to that commit line of code. You will be able to view it.

For getting back on your main branch again. Like coming back to present.
>>> git checkout <branch name>
my main branch names are main
With this we can view the previous commit just as view. So we can only view those code but won't be able to edit it. Maybe.

Revert Commit:
>>> git revert <log address>
With this we can delete some Specific commits. Like we commited some code in there then a few more commits. Revert will delete only what in that specicfic commit
Make sure everything is merged otherwise it wont work

Reset Commit:
>>> git reset <log address>     //it will show
>>> git reset <log address> --hard     //it will completely wipe out next commits and go to the past commit


This is like going back in past. it will take you to that specicfic commit while deleting the others after that commit..



Branches::::::

>>> git branch <branch name>
Create a New Branch

>>> git branch -a 
This will show us all the available Branches

>>> git checkout <branch name>
This will take you to that Specific Branch

TO delete the Branch
go to main branch. then

>>>git branch -d <branch name>
if the branch is not merged then:
>>>git branch -D <branch name>

Shortcut to create and switch to new branch
>>> git checkout -b <branch name>

Merge Branch:
>>> git merge <branch name>
You have to be in the main branch to merge it.

git push:
If we are already in the github reposotory or added Then:
>>> git push
If you want to push to a specific github reposotory Then:
>>> git push <github git link> <branch name>
On this line of code you need to paste the link each time for a Shortcut you can give the link a name by doing.
>>> git remote add <origin/other name> <git link>
Then each time you can do is:
>>> git push origin main
