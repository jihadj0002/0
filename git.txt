Checkout commit:
With this we can view the previous commit just as view. So we can only view those code but won't be able to edit it. Maybe.

Revert Commit:
With this we can delete some Specific commits. Like we commited some code in there then a few more commits. Revert will delete only what in that specicfic commit

Reset Commit:
This is like going back in past. it will take you to that specicfic commit while deleting the others after that commit..
